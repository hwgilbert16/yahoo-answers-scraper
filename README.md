# yahoo-answers-scraper
An open source scraper for Yahoo Answers before it closes.

This, however, is broken. I have not been able to find an effective way to scrape the site as Yahoo Answers works on a page-scrolling way to load new questions, instead of the traditional URL with "?question_id=something". Question IDs are randomized using a hash instead of numerical increasing, so there is not an easy way for me to scrape the site. I did not want to pay for a virtual browser.

You're more than welcome to take any of the files and adopt it into your own projects.
